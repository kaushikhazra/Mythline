## Characters
### Eliryssa - Female, Human Demonic Warlock
**About Eliryssa:**
She has turned herself to darkness for bringing goodness to the world. Her methods were questioned at the beginning, however, now she is well respected with a pinch of fear.

### Sarephine - Female, Blood Elf Fire Mage
#### About Sarephine:
Sarephine is a fire mage. She started her journey as an apprentice in Sunstrider Isle. She was trained by Magistrix Erona and she got introduced to the corruption that is grasping the land of Eversong woods.

In her journey she travelled through Falconwing Squire, Fairbreeze Village, and Farstrider Retreat. She has gained good knowledge about her history, Wretched, Amani Trolls, and the hunger for arcane power among blood elves. She choose the path of fire to avoid the indulgence to the arcane, as other has been suffering from.

#### Past Story:

Quick summary (by folder)
- wretched
  - Early apprenticeship / Sunstrider Isle arc. Tasks included thinning errant mana wyrms and corrupted tenders, retaking Falthrien Academy from a Wretched (Felendren), and assisting reclamation efforts. Sarephine kills Felendren and his wraiths, proving herself and receiving further assignments toward Falconwing Square / Silvermoon.
- Darnassian Intrusion
  - Investigation of arcane malfunctions at the West Sanctum. Sarephine fights arcane wraiths, subdues an intruder, recovers documents implicating a spy (Prospector Anvilward). She kills the spy and returns the evidence, then is ordered to aid Ranger Degolien at Fairbreeze Village.
- Amani Trolls
  - Sent from Farstrider Retreat to disrupt Amani troll settlements (Zeb'Watha, Tor'Watha). She rescues Ven'jashi, kills Spearcrafter Otembe and Zul'Marosh, recovers a battle plan showing planned attacks on Farstrider Retreat and Fairbreeze Village, and delivers Otembe’s hammer to Arathel the blacksmith. Magister Duskwither requests her attention afterward.
- Duskwither Spire (most recent)
  - Investigates destabilized arcane crystals at the Spire. Deactivates three stabilizer crystals, battles mana serpents and ether fiends, helps groundskeeper Wyllithen with cleanup, and recovers Duskwither’s investigative journal proving failed filtration experiments caused the corruption. Duskwither burns the journal and admits guilt.

What Sarephine did last
- Deactivated Duskwither Spire’s unstable arcane cores, eliminated anomalous creatures, recovered Magister Duskwither’s journal exposing failed experiments, returned it to the Magister, and witnessed him publicly destroy the journal and accept responsibility. That is the last recorded action.

Open / unresolved threads to carry forward
- Troll invasion plans found in Amani Trolls: were reinforcements or countermeasures actually deployed to Farstrider Retreat and Fairbreeze Village?
- Ven'jashi’s “gift hidden in the sand” and the hoodoo wand he gave — was the hidden item recovered; any lingering effects from Ven'jashi’s poison?
- Arathel’s use of Otembe’s hammer (crafting a weapon for Sarephine) — has the weapon been completed or used?
- Lor'althalis remains to retrieve remains at the Spire — any discoveries or consequences from that retrieval?
- Political fallout from Sarephine killing Prospector Anvilward (an Ironforge dwarf spy) — possible diplomatic complications for the Alliance.
- Magister Duskwither burned the journal — truth destroyed though guilt admitted; who else knows, and what are the long-term consequences for arcane governance?
- Possible lingering arcane instability following the Spire shutdown (regional leylines, new manifestations).
