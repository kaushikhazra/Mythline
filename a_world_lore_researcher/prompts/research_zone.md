Research the zone '{zone_name}' using your web search and crawl tools.

## Research Strategy

### Phase 1: Discover
1. Search for overview and category pages about the topic.
2. Crawl the top results to get a broad picture.
3. From the crawled content, identify specific entity NAMES (NPCs, factions, items, events).

### Phase 2: Deep Dive
4. For each important entity name discovered in Phase 1, search for and crawl its
   INDIVIDUAL wiki page (e.g., search for "Edwin VanCleef warcraft wiki" and crawl
   the dedicated page, not just the zone overview that mentions the name).
5. Prioritize individual pages for: major NPCs (10-15 most important), all named
   factions, dungeon/raid bosses, and key lore figures.

### Source Priority
- Prefer official wikis (wowpedia.fandom.com) and primary databases (warcraft.wiki.gg).
- Use wowhead.com for structured NPC/quest data.
- Avoid re-crawling URLs you have already visited — if you already have a page's content, move on to new pages.
