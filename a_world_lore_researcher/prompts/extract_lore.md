Extract lore entries for the zone '{zone_name}' from the content below.

For EACH distinct lore topic, create an entry with:
- title: Lore topic title (e.g., "The Stonemasons' Betrayal", "Rise of the Defias Brotherhood")
- category: One of: history, mythology, cosmology, power_source
- content: The lore content — include causal chains (what happened → why → consequences),
  named actors, and timeline placement. This should be a substantive summary, not a tagline.
- era: Time period or expansion this lore pertains to

Prioritize:
- Origin stories for the zone's major factions and conflicts
- Key historical events that shaped the zone's current state
- Dungeon/raid lore and boss backstories
- Character origin stories for major NPCs

Extract as many distinct lore entries as the content supports. Do not merge unrelated events.
