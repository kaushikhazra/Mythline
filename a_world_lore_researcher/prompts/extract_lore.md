Extract lore entries for the zone '{zone_name}' from the content below.

For EACH distinct lore topic, create an entry with:
- title: Lore topic title (e.g., "The Stonemasons' Betrayal", "Rise of the Defias Brotherhood")
- category: One of: history, mythology, cosmology, power_source — aim for diversity across
  categories, not all "history". See guidance below.
- content: The lore content — include causal chains (what happened → why → consequences),
  named actors, and timeline placement. This should be a substantive summary, not a tagline.
- era: Time period or expansion this lore pertains to. Be specific where possible
  (e.g., "First War", "Post-Second War", "Cataclysm", not just "Historical Event").
- sources: Source references where this lore was found (url, domain, tier)

### Category Guidance
- **history**: Wars, political events, founding of settlements, faction origins
- **mythology**: Creation myths, legends, prophecies, folk tales, religious beliefs
- **cosmology**: Ley lines, magical energies, dimensional connections, titan influence, Old God corruption
- **power_source**: Sources of magic, enchanted locations, arcane/divine/fel/nature power in the zone

Try to include entries from multiple categories when the content supports it. Most zones have
some magical or mythological dimension beyond just political history. Examples:
- **mythology**: "The Legend of Stalvan" (ghost story), local superstitions, religious traditions
- **cosmology**: Ley line convergences, titan waypoints, Old God whispers, elemental instability
- **power_source**: Holy ground at abbeys/churches, corrupted moonwells, arcane artifacts

Do NOT assign every entry as "history" — if an entry involves myths, prophecies, magical
phenomena, or power sources, use the appropriate category instead.

Prioritize:
- Origin stories for the zone's major factions and conflicts
- Key historical events that shaped the zone's current state
- Dungeon/raid lore and boss backstories
- Character origin stories for major NPCs
- Magical or cosmological significance of the zone's landmarks

Extract as many distinct lore entries as the content supports. Do not merge unrelated events.
