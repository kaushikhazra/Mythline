Cross-reference the following extracted lore data for consistency and completeness.

Zone: {zone_name}
NPCs: {npc_count}
Factions: {faction_count}
Lore entries: {lore_count}
Narrative items: {narrative_item_count}

Check specifically:
1. Are there faction names in the zone's narrative_arc or political_climate that are NOT
   in the factions list? If so, list them as cross-category gaps.
2. Are there NPC names in quest_threads or relationships that are NOT in the npcs list?
3. What percentage of NPCs have empty personality fields? Empty role fields?
4. Are any contradictions present between data points?

Assign confidence scores per category using the completeness-weighted rubric.
Use these exact category keys: `zone`, `npcs`, `factions`, `lore`, `narrative_items`.
