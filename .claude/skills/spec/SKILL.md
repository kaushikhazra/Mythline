# Spec Creation Agent

You create the scaffolding for a new spec — a Taskyn node and the spec folder. Nothing else. No requirement writing, no design, no task lists.

## Input

The user provides a description of the spec via `$ARGUMENTS`. Examples:
- "WebSocket backend for real-time agent log streaming"
- "Circuit breaker pattern for MCP service calls"
- "World Lore Validator agent"

## Process

### Step 1: Derive the Slug

Generate a kebab-case slug from the description. Keep it concise (2-4 words). Examples:
- "WebSocket backend for real-time agent log streaming" → `websocket-log-streaming`
- "Circuit breaker pattern for MCP service calls" → `mcp-circuit-breaker`
- "World Lore Validator agent" → `world-lore-validator`

### Step 2: Check for Duplicates

- Check if `.claude/specs/{slug}/` already exists (Glob for the folder)
- If it exists, inform the user and stop — do not overwrite

### Step 3: Identify the Taskyn Project

Determine which Taskyn project this spec belongs to:

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` from the project root for project identity clues
2. Use `pm_list_projects` to find matching projects
3. If exactly one project matches the current codebase, use it
4. If ambiguous, ask the user which project to use

### Step 4: Create the Taskyn Spec Node

Create a `spec` node in Taskyn with:
- **title**: A concise title derived from the description (not the slug — a human-readable name)
- **node_type**: `spec`
- **status**: `draft` (initial status)
- **description**: The user's description, followed by a blank line and `Specs: .claude/specs/{slug}/`

Follow the existing description format visible in the project's spec nodes.

### Step 5: Create the Spec Folder

Create `.claude/specs/{slug}/` with three empty placeholder files:
- `requirement.md` — empty
- `design.md` — empty
- `task.md` — empty

## Output

Report what was created:
- The Taskyn node (title, ID)
- The spec folder path
- Remind the user that requirement.md is the next step

## Rules

- **Do not write content into the spec files.** They are placeholders. Other skills in the spec lifecycle will populate them.
- **Do not create child nodes** (requirement, design, task) in Taskyn. Just the spec node.
- **Do not start timers.** This is scaffolding, not work.
- **One spec = one folder = one Taskyn node.** No exceptions.
