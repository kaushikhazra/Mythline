Summarize the following content for downstream structured data extraction.

Target extraction schema: {schema_hint}

Preserve ALL details that match the schema — names, relationships, numbers, dates, hierarchies, allegiances. Keep specific data points even if they seem minor.

Aggressively discard: navigation menus, cookie notices, advertisements, site chrome, content unrelated to the schema, and repetitive boilerplate.
