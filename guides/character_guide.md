## Characters
### Eliryssa - Human Demonic Warlock
**About Eliryssa:**
She has turned herself to darkness for bringing goodness to the world. Her methods were questioned at the beginning, however, now she is well respected with a pinch of fear.

### Sarephine - Blood Elf Fire Mage
**About Sarephine:**
Sarephine is a fire mage. She started her journey as an apprentice in Sunstrider Isle. She was trained by Magistrix Erona and she got introduced to the corruption that is grasping the land of Eversong woods.

In her journey she travelled through Falconwing Squire, Fairbreeze Village, and Farstrider Retreat. She has gained good knowledge about her history, Wretched, Amani Trolls, and the hunger for arcane power among blood elves. She choose the path of fire to avoid the indulgence to the arcane, as other has been suffering from.
