## Beating Them Back!
### Quest Introduction
The peace of Northshire is broken by the dire incursion of Blackrock worgs, fierce beasts used by the Blackrock orcs who have slipped through a mountain breach near the forest. Marshal McBride, the steadfast commander of the Northshire garrison, urgently needs brave souls to repel this threat. For Zorasana, this quest is her first trial by fire — an opportunity to demonstrate her combat prowess and loyalty to Stormwind.

### Quest Dialogue
**Marshal McBride:**  
"So you’re the new recruit from Stormwind, eh? I’m Marshal McBride, commander of this garrison. Glad to have you on board... <looks through some papers> ... Zorasana, is it? You’ve arrived just in time."  

**Zorasana:**  
"Marshal, I am ready to serve. What are the orders?"  

**Marshal McBride:**  
"The Blackrock orcs have managed to sneak into Northshire through a break in the mountain. My soldiers are holding the line, but I fear they will be overwhelmed soon. Head northwest into the forest and kill six of those Blackrock worgs attacking us. Help my soldiers — they need every able hand!"  

### Quest Execution  
Zorasana gathered her staff and cloaked her shoulders in her mage’s robes, steeling her resolve. She planned to approach the forest edge cautiously, staying alert for any signs of the worgs or orcs coordinating their beasts. Travelling northwest from the Abbey, the undergrowth grew thick and the shadows long. Her keen mage senses tingled as she entered a clearing where growls and snarls split the air. With a combination of ice shards to slow the beasts and swift fireballs to strike from a distance, she carefully picked off each worg. The battles were fierce, with beasts lunging from hidden cover, but Zorasana’s training here was paying off. After the sixth worg fell, silence descended upon the forest once more, and her heart swelled with the pride of a mission accomplished — she had earned her first victory in defense of Northshire.

### Quest Completion
**Marshal McBride:**  
"You’ve bought us a little time, Zorasana, but we’ve got even bigger problems ahead. Your bravery is commendable — Stormwind needs soldiers like you."  

**Zorasana:**  
"I'll be ready for whatever comes next, Marshal. This is just the beginning."

## Lions for Lambs
### Quest Introduction
With the worg threat pushed back, intelligence reports reveal spies amidst the Blackrock orcs are watching Northshire troop movements, preparing for a larger assault. Marshal McBride task Zorasana with rooting out these spies, critical to gaining the upper hand in the unfolding conflict. This mission will test not only her combative skills but her vigilance and cunning.

### Quest Dialogue
**Marshal McBride:**  
"The invading orcs aren’t fools, Zorasana. They’re sizing us up, watching our every move through spyglasses in the forest to the northwest. I want you to take the fight to those Blackrock spies!"  

**Zorasana:**  
"I understand. I will find them and send a message — we are watching as well."  

### Quest Execution  
Zorasana devised her approach carefully. Stealth and arcane precision would be key to deal with scouts adept at hiding. Moving quietly among the trees, she tracked brief glimpses of the spies through measurements of their movements and footprints. When confrontation was inevitable, she unleashed precise arcane blasts to incapacitate them before they could warn their comrades. Through systematic patrolling and employing her mage traps, she eliminated eight spies, disrupting the enemy’s reconnaissance network and safeguarding the garrison’s secrets.

### Quest Completion
**Marshal McBride:**  
"Excellent work, Zorasana. Your alertness and skill make you a formidable asset to this garrison. It’s time you sharpen your skills in earnest — your training continues."  

**Zorasana:**  
"I will continue to improve. Northshire will stand strong."

## Glyphic Letter
### Quest Introduction
As she settles from recent trials, Marshal McBride presents Zorasana with a sealed parchment — a glyphic letter bearing the mage trainer Khelden Bremen’s insignia. This letter holds guidance vital for her arcane education. It promises knowledge and a direction for mastering the mystic arts.

### Quest Dialogue
**Marshal McBride:**  
"I was asked to bring this to your attention as soon as you returned from dealing with the spies, Zorasana. It’s a letter sealed with the insignia of Khelden, our mage trainer here at the Abbey. I wouldn’t hesitate to read it before taking on anything else."  

**Zorasana:**  
"I appreciate the trust, Marshal. I shall see what wisdom it contains."  

### Quest Execution  
Zorasana made her way to the upper library wing of Northshire Abbey, to find Khelden Bremen engrossed in arcane manuscripts. She presented the letter and listened intently as Khelden conveyed his confidence in her potential. The letter marked the beginning of her formal tutelage under Khelden’s oversight, promising rigorous instruction and unlocking new mysteries of magic as she grows.

### Quest Completion
**Khelden Bremen:**  
"Haha, I knew my note wouldn’t dissuade you from your path. So, you’re prepared, are you? Prepared to accept your fate? To challenge gods and any forces in your pursuit of knowledge and power? You will be feared and respected alike. I’ll be here whenever you’re ready for training. Seek me out as you grow."  

**Zorasana:**  
"I am ready to walk this path, Khelden. I will not turn back."

## Mastering the Arcane
### Quest Introduction
With Khelden’s mentorship, Zorasana is charged with mastering a new spell that will mark a milestone in her arcane development — Frost Nova. Mastery of this spell is essential, as it embodies the control and power she must wield to defend her home effectively.

### Quest Dialogue
**Khelden Bremen:**  
"As a mage, you will learn many spells, Zorasana. But first, you must reach level 3 and learn Frost Nova. Practice casting it twice on the training dummies south of the Abbey entrance. Let the secrets of the arcane reveal themselves through your efforts."  

**Zorasana:**  
"I will train diligently until the spell flows through me with control and power."  

### Quest Execution  
Zorasana spent hours outdoors practicing the Frost Nova spell. She focused her energies, reaching within for the arcane currents. Carefully, she unleashed the spell twice on the mute training dummies arranged in a circle. Each cast was a triumph of concentration and magic control, the icy blast freezing and slowing her targets. This practice was tangible proof of her growing mastery, strengthening her resolve to become a formidable mage.

### Quest Completion
**Khelden Bremen:**  
"Have you mastered the use of Frost Nova already? You are a quick study and your future as a mage looks promising. Remember to return when you grow more powerful; I will train you further."  

**Zorasana:**  
"I will not forget your guidance, Khelden. This is only the beginning."

## Join the Battle!
### Quest Introduction
Reports reach Marshal McBride and the trainers that the Blackrock orcs have hired goblin assassins to ambush Stormwind’s battalion behind the Abbey. This marks a new level of threat, and Sergeant Willem urgently calls for aid. Zorasana is chosen to volunteer, tasked with joining the battle — an essential duty that tests courage and readiness to risk life for the realm.

### Quest Dialogue
**Class Trainer:**  
"While you were training, Sergeant Willem sent word. Goblin assassins hired by the Blackrock orcs ambushed our battalion behind the Abbey. He’s asked me to send a hero. You must go, Zorasana!"  

**Marshal McBride:**  
"I have an urgent message, Zorasana. Our forces are ambushed behind the Abbey by goblin assassins. Sergeant Willem awaits your help. Go now!"  

### Quest Execution  
Stepping out from the Abbey’s safety, Zorasana headed north towards the command tent where Sergeant Willem coordinated the battle. She scanned for signs of the ambush and prepared her spells. Arriving just in time, she saw the battalion under siege — goblin shadowstalkers darting in and out of cover. Combining quick freezes and fiery blasts, she disabled several assassins before they reached the soldiers. Her fierce defense turned the tide, giving the battalion breathing space and renewed hope to hold their ground.

### Quest Completion
**Sergeant Willem:**  
"It’s true, we were ambushed. I can’t risk more lives out there. I need a volunteer, someone who will stand firm. You’ve done well, Zorasana, but more is to come."  

**Zorasana:**  
"I’m ready to stand again. Northshire’s safety isn’t just duty — it’s my resolve."
