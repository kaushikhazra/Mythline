# Formatting Evaluation Rubric

Evaluate if the research output is organized in a readable markdown format.

## Evaluation Priority
1. **If file_content is not null/empty**: Evaluate the file_content primarily
2. **If file_content is null/empty**: Evaluate the research_summary

## Criterion
Is the information organized in a readable markdown format with proper paragraphs and structure?

## Scoring
- **1.0**: Well-formatted markdown, easy to read and understand
- **0.5**: Basic formatting but could be clearer or better organized
- **0.0**: Poor formatting, hard to read, or no markdown structure
