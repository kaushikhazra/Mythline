# Sources Evaluation Rubric

Evaluate if the research output shows evidence of using web sources.

## Evaluation Priority
1. **If file_content is not null/empty**: Evaluate the file_content primarily
2. **If file_content is null/empty**: Evaluate the research_summary

## Criterion
Does the output appear to use web sources (mentions URLs, external content, or references)?

## Scoring
- **1.0**: Clear evidence of web research with URLs or external references
- **0.5**: Some indication of external sources but not explicit
- **0.0**: No evidence of web sources or external research
